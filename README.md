React Notes
 - To run the project -> Run 'npm run dev' in terminal

 - main.jsx
    - It connects index.html to App.jsx
 
 - Components
    - Any function which starts with a capital letter and returns jsx
    - It can only return a single top-level element.
      If there are more elements, they are often enclosed in a fragment
    - They can be further broken down into smaller components

 - Fragment
    - An element with an empty tag
    - Syntax: <> </>
 
 - App.jsx 
    - It's the first component

 - .js v/s .jsx syntax
    - class     className
    - for       htmlFor

 - State
    - import { use, useState } from "react"
    - const [variable, function_To_Update_Variable_Value] = useState("Variable_Value")
